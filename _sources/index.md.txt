# Andrea Bocci Web Page

**Welcome to my web page 2!**

I work in an innovation Lab as a Data Scientist, with the goal to
bring new technologies and ideas into the business. 

This site follows a similar approach: I experiment different layouts
and documentation frameworks to write about data science (and other
technical) topics that often includes code, plots or math equations.

**Therefore this web site is an evolving experiment eternally work in progress, and an amalgam of different styles and layouts.**


By design.

### Why Sphinx?

```
------   


There are plenty of static web page framework out there, in the past I
was using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) (that actually I
recommend!) for example, but in recent years I was accumulating notes
in notebook format and my wish-list basically included:

* A pythonic framework
* Write pages in markdown, better with richer capability (like [reStructureText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html))
* Easily convert notebooks to pages to be posted on this site
* While having fun writing content to this web site, become more proficient on properly/automatically document code, projects and libraries.

Clearly there was nothing around that could fit all my requirements, in particular in the popular [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) ecosystem, 
as I still want to experiment with [Jupyter
Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html),
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [Executable Books
Project](https://executablebooks.org), [Edward Tufte
markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/) and other stuff.

But eventually I found [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
with [PyData-sphinx-theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io)
a good compromise. Also I was convinced by [this post from Chris
Holdgraf](https://predictablynoisy.com/posts/2020/sphinx-blogging/),
which gives quite a few compelling arguments on using it.


So, I did what any Data Scientist does to start from scratch a new
project: **I forked a repository!** 

In my case [Chris Holdgraf web
page](https://predictablynoisy.com/), that I profoundly thank for the
excellent work and documentation he makes his web site (still have to
implement the GitHub Actions he uses to automatize the deployment).

## Site Structure
(Information taken from [Chris Holdgraf web
page](https://predictablynoisy.com/))


- **Where is the blog source code?**  (TBD)
- **What engine builds the website?** The [Sphinx documentation engine](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is the core documentation engine.
- **What engine builds the blog?** I use the [ablog Sphinx blog extension](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/) to host the actual blog.
- **What theme do you use for the blog?** I use the [PyData Sphinx Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/)
- **How do you write Sphinx docs in markdown?** I use the [myst-parser package](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- **How do you write content in notebooks?** I use the [MyST-NB package](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- **How did you make those fancy buttons and dropdowns?** That was the [sphinx-panels Sphinx extension](https://sphinx-panels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Content

This will be a blog-style web site, but I will experiment with layouts.

Data Science topics
: Usual Medium-like articles, probably more advanced, on stuff I tried first hand or I like to discuss. Including Statistic and relevant math topics.

Project topics
: Those may require multiple pages, and layout more similar to proper documentation or html-book. Experimenting in this area is actually one of the motivation to make this web site

Other topics
: Again to experiment different layout, for example [Edward Tufte
markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/), using old notebbok or other format I have. Mainly about data analysis of some interesting topic, or some math, astronomy or else.
