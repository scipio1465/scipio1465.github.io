# About me

I am a Full Stack Data Scientist, and a former particle physicist.

It's not unluckily to find me around at Data Science related Meetups and events in London.

I currently work in **The Lab** team at [Virgin Media
O2](https://www.virginmediao2.co.uk/), an Innovation Lab
cross-functional team that explores new technologies to drive
innovation across the business.

In my role I leverage the data asset of the company to solve
challenging problems, increase competitiveness with ML models and
predicting analytics, mitigate risks and optimize processes working
horizontally across the business.

New ideas and approaches are channeled in proof of concept solutions that
eventually can be scaled and expanded to production.

## Data Science Interests

</br>

I think the back of my _"battlefield"_ laptop speaks for itself. I use
and experiment all kind of frameworks, tools and libraries. As a
lifelong Linux user, I give a preference to open source products, but
in general I take whatever fit best for my purpose. 

Cloud Services
: I used Azure for some projects, but I've been more on GCP recently

Cluster Computing
: I worked a lot with PySpark and I love it! I like Dask as well, and
  experimenting recently with Polars and CuDF.

ML
: Usually scikit-learn fits the bill, I like LightBGM for tabular
  supervised learning, otherwise Tensorflow ecosystem (but PyTorch 2.0
  is arriving, maybe a reason to switch?). I also like Bayesian models
  (pyMC) and such. Working in telecommunication sector I've been
  looking at Graph ML models and Geospatial analysis, a two great
  passions of mine. Plus of course all other big DS topics that you
  need to know to have fun on Kaggle!
  
MLOps:
: To be honest, once you know the principles (CI/CD, pipelines, monitoring, etc..)
  any tool integrated in cloud services are usually good enough. I
  like MLFlow, and not only because is coming from the Spark
  ecosystem.
  
Visualization:

: I was a power user of Matplotlib/Seaborn, but now I'm totally a
  plotly converted! If you try it, you won't go back. Still, I find
  the HoloViz ecosystem projects quite intriguing, even beyond data
  visualization. For Geo-related stuff I hope kepler will continue to
  evolve as it is an interesting approach.




Other:
: GAN, synthetic data, differential privacy, explainable AI, and many more...



## Certifications

In general **I don't believe in any form of "_proof_" of knowledge**, be
it an academic degree or a professional certification. 

But since my company has been generously sponsoring (_a.k.a._ paying) for
them, well, why not! And I didn't regret it the effort as I learned a lot
preparing for them! 

They are not a _proof_ of your knowledge, but
surely they are a _mean_ to improve your knowledge! (although there are
many other ways and **free** resources to do the same).


## Other interests

I probably won't post much on the many other interests I have, with
few exceptions that fit the case, for example if it's an excuse to do
a little DS/tech project (as the [_live_ Book Reading Logbook plot below](book-log))
Also I'll have some _math_ posts, as I want to experiment with latex,
interactive/executable code, and I have many notes to be used as a source.

And last but
not least because I'm a **puzzle addicted!**

That's my badge on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), an incredible site of challenging computational
problems with a math-_ish_ spin. Brute force won't get you very far, you need some (actually **a lot** of)  ingenuity to simplify the problem enough to be able to compute
the solution in a finite time.

## A rough timeline

 
Below is a rough timeline of what I've been up to over the past several years, inspired again by [Chris Holdgraf implementation with Sphinx](https://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2020/sphinx-design-timeline/)

**2023**: This **blog** went live
^^^

Revamped the idea of having a web site, experimenting with static and
interactive documentation frameworks like Sphinx, MyST, JupyterBook and
slowly adding contents.

**2019**: Joined **The Lab** at  [Virgin Media
O2](https://www.virginmediao2.co.uk/),
^^^

Full stack Data Scientist working across the business to foster
innovation and bring in new technologies. Some area I
worked on:
- ML model for customer credit risk
- Insurance  claim propensity predictions
- Network performance impact on customer value and churn

**2018**: Science to Data Science Fellow
^^^

Five-week intensive project with Astrazeneca on a proof-of-concept
prototype of a **Knowledge Graph** database realized with Neo4J
targeting use cases as drug repositioning

**2006-2019**: Research Scientist at CERN
^^^

Worked as a member of the ATLAS international collaboration at
the **Large Hadron Collider** (LHC).

Over the years I covered many roles on data quality, monitoring,
curation, acquisition, distribution, detector operation, data and
detector simulation, as well of course statistical analysis of the
data.

Gradated at the Rockefeller University, NY with a thesis on "_Search For Diboson Production With Artificial Neural Network Selection_"

## What I Am Reading 
(book-log)=

If you are curious **on what I'm currently
reading** and **at which page I am**, here it is (a sort of _embedded-dashboard_ if you're into buzzy terminology)

```{image} https://abprojects.blob.core.windows.net/webpage-hd/ReadingLogPlot.png
:target:  https://abprojects.blob.core.windows.net/webpage-hd/ReadingLogPlot.png
```

</br></br>

This plot is updated **nightly** with an _Azure Function_. [In this
post](panels-timeline.md) I explain the design of my **Book Reading
Log** and how I have implemented it.
