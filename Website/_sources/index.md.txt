I work in tech, where there are always new stuff coming out to try and
test. 

This site follows a similar approach. I experiment different
layouts and documentation frameworks to mumbling about data science
and other (technical) topics that often includes code, plots or math
equations.


### Why Sphinx?
```{image} https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/_static/sphinxheader.png

```
</br>


There are plenty of static web page framework out there. In the past I
was using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) (highly
recommended!) for example, But in recent years I was accumulating notes
in notebook format and my wish-list for a personal website/blog evolved into including:

* A pythonic framework
* Pages in markdown, better with richer capability (like [reStructureText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html))
* Easy conversion of  (jupyter) notebooks to blog posts for this web site
* While having fun writing content to this web site, become more
  proficient on properly/automatically documenting code, projects and
  libraries.

Clearly there was nothing around that could really fit the bill,
in particular in the popular [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) ecosystem,
as I still want to experiment with [Jupyter
Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html),
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [Executable Books
Project](https://executablebooks.org), [Edward Tufte
markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/) and other stuff like that.

But eventually I found [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
with
[PyData-sphinx-theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io), a
good compromise. [This post from Chris
Holdgraf](https://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2020/sphinx-blogging/)
gives actually quite a few compelling arguments to use it as blog
framework.

<div class="alert alert-success">So I did what any Data Scientist does to start from scratch a new
project: <b>I forked a repository!</b>
</div>


In my case [Chris Holdgraf web page](https://chrisholdgraf.com) that
I profoundly thank for the excellent work and documentation about 
his web site (_I still have to implement the GitHub Actions he uses to
automatize the deployment..._).

## Site Structure
(Information taken from [Chris Holdgraf web
page](https://chrisholdgraf.com))


- **Where is the blog source code?**  (TBD)
- **What engine builds the website?** The [Sphinx documentation engine](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is the core documentation engine.
- **What engine builds the blog?** I use the [ablog Sphinx blog extension](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/) to host the actual blog.
- **What theme do you use for the blog?** I use the [PyData Sphinx Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/)
- **How do you write Sphinx docs in markdown?** I use the [myst-parser package](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- **How do you write content in notebooks?** I use the [MyST-NB package](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- **How did you make those fancy buttons and dropdowns?** That was the [sphinx-panels Sphinx extension](https://sphinx-panels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Content

This will be a blog-style web site, but I will experiment with layouts.

Data Science topics
: Usual Medium-like articles, probably more advanced, on stuff I tried
  first hand or I like to discuss. Including Statistic and other relevant topics. 

Project topics
: Those may require multiple pages, and layout more similar to proper
  documentation or html-book (thinking at [Jupyter
Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) or
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/))  Experimenting in this area is actually
  one of the motivation to start this web site

Other topics
: Again to experiment different layout, for example [Edward Tufte
markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/), using old notes or other
format I have. Mainly about data analysis of some interesting topics
on the news or particularly popular (I have few ones Covid-related), always
with a data spin.
Or some math. Or astronomy. Or else.
